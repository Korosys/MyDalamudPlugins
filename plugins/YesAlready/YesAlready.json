Yes Already is specifically designed to click all the annoying dialogs you've grown accustomed facerolling. Just enter the dialog text, and you'll never see it again! Also works with /regex/ and has several built-in modules for dialogs that aren't quite yes/no prompts but act like it (like desynth).",
